# Language Translator Using Angular And Azure Cognitive Services

Connecting with people in various countries across the world comes with a lot of challenges. The most common one is language barriers. Studies show that 75% of people prefer to communicate in their native language. This is possible with the help of language translation. So this project will help people to translate the text into there native language and understand effectively . At the same time they can come up with new ideas and can grow there knowledge.
we are going to create a language translator using Angular and the Translate Text Azure Cognitive Service. This translator will be able to translate  languages which are supported by the Translate Text API. We will supply the text to translate and the target language to our application and it will return the translated text and the detected language of the input text. We have created a Translator Text Cognitive Services resource on Azure. We have used the Translator Text API to create a multi language translator using Blazor. This translator supports more than 60 languages for translation. We fetched the list of supported languages for translation from the global API endpoint for Translator Text.
